Most weeks, last two days will be dedicated to statistical computing. Class Materials Textbook: OpenIntro Statistics, 4th Ed Technology: Access to a word processing program. R and RStudio (These are free and we will get them setup during our first lab day) A graphing calculator, preferably a TI-83 or TI-84. A Casio FX-9750GII will also work (useful but optional). Graded Items and Grading Guidelines This section is a work in progress and will likely change Weights of Grades: Category Weight Homework 20% Quizzes 25% Labs 20% Paper 10% Final 25% Total 100% Homework: All homework assignments will be online using WAMAP. For these assignments, you will have 3 attempts per question. After the third attempt you will be shown the answer. You can reattempt each question as many times as youd like! Homework must be completed by 11:59 pm. You will not be able to complete the quiz until you have finished a modules homework assignments with a 50% or better! Your lowest 3 assignments will be dropped. Quizzes: Each module will have a quiz closely related to the homework. The quiz will be locked until you meet the prerequisites. Your lowest quiz will be dropped. If you miss a quiz it counts as your dropped score. Labs: We will have weekly coding sessions and workshops with the exception of weeks seven and fourteen. Your lowest two labs (workshop assignments) will be dropped. Paper: Each student will be required to write a paper about statistics in the media. Details will be given out in the second week of class via the Class Communications guidelines. The paper is due no later than the Last Day of Instruction (see Important Dates below). If there is a week where you dont have much work in your other classes or our class didnt take you long then you may want to knock out the paper early in the semester. Final: The final project will be partly in R and partly on WAMAP. It will be due no later than Friday, May 28.

The topic for the code along/live code will be the same for the workshop. Throughout the semester, I will use the same data set for as many weeks as possible, that way you can see how the data analysis process works for an entire project as opposed to isolated problems.
