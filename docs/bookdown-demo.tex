It is assumed that you will have done some reading and/or watched the video lessons \textbf{BEFORE} coming to class on Monday and Wednesday. Those classes will start with a brief discussion of the material and segue into a problem solving session.

For the Live Coding \& Workshop sessions, we will start with a lesson on a specific element of statistical computing. This will be the live coding part; you'll have your laptop closed and can watch the process of structuring a file, troubleshooting errors and anything else that can come up when writing code. The remainder of class will be spent in workshop mode, which allows you to begin the lab assignment as well as collaborate with your peers.

\hypertarget{homework}{%
\subsubsection{Homework:}\label{homework}}

Homework will not be graded but quiz and final exam questions will be heavily based on problems assigned for homework. All solutions that are not in the back of the textbook will be posted on the Homework Solutions page.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsubsection{Quizzes:}\label{quizzes}}

There will be one in-class quiz for each chapter (seven total). Quiz questions will be a mix of computation and short answer, no multiple choice. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

\hypertarget{labs}{%
\subsubsection{Labs:}\label{labs}}

We will have weekly coding sessions and workshops with the exception of weeks seven and fourteen. Your lowest two labs (workshop assignments) will be dropped. Late lab submissions will be accepted within 24 hours of the due date with a 15\% deduction and will not be accepted past the 24 hour mark.

\hypertarget{paper}{%
\subsubsection{Paper:}\label{paper}}

Each student will be required to write a paper about statistics in the media. Details will be given out in the second week of class via email and the Announcements page. The paper is due no later than the Last Day of Instruction (see Important Dates below). If there is a week where you don't have much work in your other classes or our class didn't take you long then you may want to knock out the paper early in the semester.

\hypertarget{final}{%
\subsubsection{Final:}\label{final}}

The final will have two parts: one in-class exam (similar to the quizzes) and a take-home lab to be completed as an RMarkdown file. The lab is due when you come in for the in-class final. Late lab submissions will be accepted within 24 hours of the due date with a 15\% deduction and will not be accepted past the 24 hour mark.

\hypertarget{r-labs}{%

Each week we will have a code along/live code session as well as a workshop. The topic for the code along/live code will be the same for the workshop. Throughout the semester, I will use the same data set for as many weeks as possible, that way you can see how the data analysis process works for an entire project as opposed to isolated problems. Below is a tentative schedule of topics.

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
Week & Topic\\
\hline
One & Getting Started with R\\
\hline
Two & RMarkdown Crash Course\\
\hline
Three & Data Viz I\\
\hline
Four & Descriptive Statistics I\\
\hline
Five & Data Wrangling I\\
\hline
Six & Data Wrangling II\\
\hline
Seven & NO LAB\\
\hline
Eight & Data Viz II\\
\hline
Nine & Descriptive Statistics II\\
\hline
Ten & Inferential Statistics I\\
\hline
Eleven & Inferential Statistics II\\
\hline
Twelve & Linear Modeling I\\
\hline
Thirteen & Linear Modeling II\\
\hline
Fourteen & NO LAB\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\emph{Notes:}
- There will not be a code along/live coding session for week one.
- Week two's code along/live code will be a preview of some things you'll learn throughout the semester.
- There will be a screencasted version of the code along/live coding sessions posted on this page on Thursday evenings.
