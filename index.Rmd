<img style="float: left;" src = "images/stat231_sticker.png" width ="150px"/> Statistics are everywhere. The goal of this course is to give a broad overview of statistical methods and analysis including measures of central tendency and dispersion and generalizations about populations from samples by parametric and nonparametric techniques. Methods covered will include estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, regression, chi square, and ANOVA analysis. There is also a required computer lab which will introduce the statistical programming language R and how it can be used for analysis and data visualization.
